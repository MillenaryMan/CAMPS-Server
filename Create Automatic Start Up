To automatically run your game server on startup on Ubuntu, you can create a systemd service unit. Here's how you can do it:

Create a systemd Service Unit File:

Open a terminal on your Ubuntu server.

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/game_server.service
Replace game_server with a name of your choice for the service.

Add the Service Configuration:

Inside the file, add the following lines:

[Unit]
Description=Game Server Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/root/CAMPS/CAMPS.x86_64 -batchmode -nographics -logfile /path/to/logfile.log

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Modify the ExecStart line to include the command needed to start your game server. Replace /root/CAMPS/CAMPS.x86_64 with the path to your game server executable and /path/to/logfile.log with the desired path to your log file.

Save and Close the File:
After making the necessary changes, save and close the file by pressing Ctrl + X, then Y, and finally Enter.

Reload systemd and Enable the Service:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable game_server
This reloads systemd to pick up the changes you made and enables the service to start automatically on boot.

Start the Service:

sudo systemctl start game_server
This command starts the service immediately. You can verify that it's running properly by checking its status:

sudo systemctl status game_server
Reboot Your Server:

To test if the service starts automatically on boot, you can reboot your server:

sudo reboot[]
After the server has rebooted, check if the game server service is running:

sudo systemctl status game_server
That's it! Your game server should now start automatically on boot on your Ubuntu server. Adjust the paths and commands in the service unit file according to your specific setup.
