Step 1: Update Your Server
Always start by updating the package lists and upgrading existing packages to ensure everything is up-to-date:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Step 3: Install LXDE
(It's known for being extremely lightweight)
```
sudo apt install -y lxde
```

Step 4: Install XRDP
XRDP allows you to connect using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP):
```
sudo apt install -y xrdp
```
Step 5: Configure XRDP to Use LXDE
Configure XRDP to start LXDE when you connect. By default, XRDP might attempt to use another environment, so you need to specify LXDE:
```
echo "lxsession -s LXDE -e LXDE" > ~/.xsession
```
Restart the XRDP service to apply these changes:
```
sudo systemctl restart xrdp
```

Step 6: Allow RDP through the Firewall
Make sure the RDP port (3389) is allowed through the serverâ€™s firewall:
```
sudo ufw allow 3389/tcp
```
